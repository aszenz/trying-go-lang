# GO Basics

## Code examples and exercises from [Practice TDD with Go][1]

## GO is highly opinianted and is all about convention
## Single workspace, where all go code is to be put
## Three directories in a workspace bin, pkg, src
## src contains one or more source control repositories with one or more packages
## Public or exported fields need to have their first letter be capitalized
## Private functions start with a lowercase letter
## Excellent out of the box tooling for testing, benchmarking, refactoring and formatting code.
